Package prettier can't be external

Mastra telemetry is enabled, but the required instrumentation file was not loaded. If you are using Mastra outside of the mastra server environment, see: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/observability/tracing#tracing-outside-mastra-server-environment If you are using a custom instrumentation file or want to disable this warning, set the globalThis.___MASTRA_TELEMETRY___ variable to true in your instrumentation file.
Mastra telemetry is deprecated and will be removed on the Nov 4th release. Instead use AI Tracing. More info can be found here: https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/8577 and here: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/observability/ai-tracing/overview
The `format: "aisdk"` is deprecated in stream/generate options. Use the @mastra/ai-sdk package instead. See https://mastra.ai/en/docs/frameworks/agentic-uis/ai-sdk#streaming
