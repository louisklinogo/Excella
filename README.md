Excella is the first data analyst that actually lives inside your spreadsheets.

I built it because, as a former data analyst, I know how painful Excel can get — cleaning messy data, fixing broken formulas, transforming the same columns over and over, and trying to make sense of numbers under pressure.

Excella’s goal is to democratize analysis. Anyone, regardless of skill level, should be able to understand their data, explore it, run models, and get clear insights — all without leaving Excel.

Inspired by tools like Julius AI, Excella lets you do more than just write formulas. Directly in your workbook, you can ask questions, clean data, build models, run Python, or simply say "explain this to me" — and Excella handles the messy work so you can focus on decisions.

It’s Excel, but with a data analyst’s brain built in.
